In the world of website development, the battle between static websites and dynamic platforms like WordPress has been
ongoing. While both have their merits, static websites offer a range of advantages that make them a compelling choice
for many developers. Because of those advantages I chose to create this personal website with Jekyll by using the
Creative theme. It's hosted on AWS by using an S3 bucket and leveraging the Content Delivery capabilities of Cloudfront.
In this blog, we'll explore the benefits of static websites and guide you through the process of creating one using
Jekyll, hosting it on AWS S3, and leveraging CloudFront for enhanced performance and delivery.

## Advantages of Static Websites:

1. **Speed and Performance:** Static websites are incredibly fast because they consist of pre-rendered HTML, CSS, and
   JavaScript files. This eliminates the need for server-side processing, resulting in quicker load times and a better
   user experience.
2. **Security:** Static websites are inherently more secure as they lack server-side processing and databases, reducing
   the risk of potential vulnerabilities. There are fewer attack vectors, making them less susceptible to hacking
   attempts.
3. **Scalability:** Since static websites require minimal server resources, they can handle high levels of traffic
   without facing the scalability challenges that dynamic platforms might encounter.
4. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Hosting a static website is typically cheaper as it doesn't require complex server
   infrastructure or database management. This is especially beneficial for small businesses and individuals.
5. **Simplicity:** Static websites are easier to create and maintain. They don't require constant updates, patches, or
   plugin management, which can be time-consuming with dynamic platforms.
6. **Reliability:** Without complex server setups and databases, static websites are less likely to experience downtime
   due to server-related issues.

## AWS S3 and Cloudfront

Combined AWS S3 and Cloudfront make the perfect platform that allows us to host a static website that really delivers on
the before mentioned advantages.

**AWS S3:** Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable cloud storage service. It lets you store and retrieve data,
including files, images, and videos. S3 is highly reliable and offers cost-effective storage options. It's a simple and
efficient way to store your website's files in the cloud.

**AWS CloudFront:** Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN). It helps deliver your website's content to
users
with low latency and high data transfer speeds. CloudFront caches your website's files across multiple locations
globally, reducing the distance data needs to travel, resulting in faster load times.

## Creating a Static Website with Jekyll, AWS S3, and AWS CloudFront:

#### **Jekyll Setup:** First we'll install Ruby and create a Jekyll project.

* Follow <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/" target="_blank">this installation guide</a> to install Ruby
  and RubyGems.
* Install Jekyll using the command: `gem install jekyll`.
* Create a new Jekyll project: `jekyll new my-static-site`.
* Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-static-site`.

#### **Build and Test:**

* Build your Jekyll site: `jekyll build`.
* Test your site locally: `jekyll serve`. Access it in your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

#### **AWS S3 Setup:**

* Sign in to your AWS account.
* Create an S3 bucket with a unique name.
* Configure the bucket for static website hosting, enabling public access.
  Follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html#step2-create-bucket-config-as-website" target="_blank">
  this AWS Guide</a> on how to get this done.

#### **Upload Content:**

* Upload the contents of your _site folder (generated by Jekyll) to the S3 bucket.
* Ensure that the objects are set to public so they can be accessed.

#### **CloudFront Integration:**

* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/getting-started/S3/" target="_blank">Create a new CloudFront
  distribution</a>.
* Set the origin domain as your S3 bucket.
* Configure behaviors to forward and cache requests.
* Manage your Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate in order to support HTTPS

#### **Domain Configuration:**

* Configure your domain's DNS to point to your CloudFront distribution's domain name. This is easiest when you manage
  your domain in AWS Route 53.

Static websites have proven to be a powerful alternative to dynamic platforms like WordPress, offering benefits in terms
of speed, security, scalability, cost, simplicity, and reliability. By using tools like Jekyll, AWS S3, and CloudFront,
you can easily create and deploy your own static website, taking advantage of these benefits while ensuring optimal
performance and user experience. Whether you're a developer looking for efficient solutions or a business seeking a
streamlined online presence, static websites deserve serious consideration.
